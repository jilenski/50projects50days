          <h3>Fullmetal Alchemist</h3>
          <p>
            <span>Plot Summary: </span>After losing their mother, Alphonse and
            Edward Elric attempt to bring her back using the forbidden science
            of human alchemy. However, alchemy operates on the theory of
            equivalent trade, and breaking the human alchemy taboo carries a
            heavy price. Ed loses his leg, and Al loses his body. Ed is able to
            seal Al’s soul inside of a huge suit of armor, at the cost of his
            arm. Years later, Ed (now with two mechanical limbs) and Al (still
            trapped in the armor) leave their childhood home, each brother
            concerned with the other’s happiness. Ed, who has a natural talent
            and skill for alchemy, becomes nationally certified and is soon
            known everywhere as the “Fullmetal Alchemist.” Their true objective
            is to search for any information on the fabled Philosopher’s Stone,
            hoping it will allow them to regain their old bodies. All of their
            hopes rest with this mythical stone, which may not even exist at
            all. However, the brothers soon learn that they are not the only
            ones after the powerful stone.
